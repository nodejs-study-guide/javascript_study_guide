The "document" object is one of javascript's standard objects.

The "document" object represents an entire web page object.

Remember in javascript, an object is golang's version of a struct.

So a document object is essentially a struct with lots of nested structed structs.








Here "getElementById" is a method for the "document" object.

This method outputs another object (aka struct), and we use the "textContent" to access a particular key (aka property) in that object and use the "=" sign to change it to something else.
