// ternary-operators, are if-else statetents written in a single line, e.g.:


let price = 28 ;

(price > 20) ? console.log("expensive") : console.log("cheap")

// the round brackets around the condition part is actually optional but is best practice to always include them for readability. 

// It can also be used to set variables:


let answer = (price > 25) ? "very expensive" : "a little expensive"

console.log(answer)
