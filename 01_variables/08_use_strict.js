// "use strict"
// 'use strict'
// The following works without needing to declared the variable using the "let" keyword. 
msg = "hello"

console.log(msg) // hello


// This is bad practice. To avoid this happening, you can start each .js file (or js function) with the line "'use strict'"
// That enables strict mode, and also disables any legacy javascript syntax.
