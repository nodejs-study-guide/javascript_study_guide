// plain javasript works for declaring a variable
var helloWorld = "Hello World";
console.log(helloWorld);
// That's because, typescript is smart enough to work it out for you. 
// Here's the more explicit approach. Being more explicit is recommeded.
// This is called annotating a variable. 
var employeeName = "John Smith";
console.log(employeeName);
// you can declar a variable and then assign a value to it later. 
var employeeName2;
employeeName2 = "David smith";
console.log(employeeName2);
