npm is now used for all javascript code, not just node, e.g. it hosts packages for use in front end development.  

## What is a package?

The name "package" is what npm uses to label the bits of reusable code. 

A "Node package" (aka module) is basically a **folder** that contains .js files. So any folder that contains javascript code is called a package (or module). 


## the npm cli

the npm cli get's installed as part of node itself, so you don't have to install it seperately.
